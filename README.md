# AI Face Emotion Detection

This project is part of my CS portfolio, aiming to build a real-time face detection and emotion classification system using Python and deep learning libraries — fully from scratch.

---

## 🎯 Core Features

- ✅ Real-time webcam feed
- ✅ Face detection using OpenCV
- ✅ Emotion classification using a small reference dataset
- ✅ Logging detections to CSV (timestamp, emotion, image/frame ID)

---

## 🧠 Tech Stack

- Python
- OpenCV
- TensorFlow / Keras
- NumPy
- Matplotlib (for testing/visualization)

## 📅 Project Timeline

| Week | Task                                     |
|------|------------------------------------------|
| 1    | Setup, dataset prep, repo initialized    |
| 2    | Face detection working                   |
| 3    | Emotion classifier working               |
| 4    | Combine features, polish UI, record demo |

## 🧪 Demo

Demo video, screenshots, and results will be added once core features are completed.

---

## 🔮 Possible Additions (Optional after MVP)

- Object recognition with YOLO or Haar cascades
- Distance estimation from camera (depth inference)
- Face recognition ( with testing data base )
